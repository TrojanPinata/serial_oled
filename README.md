# Very Small OLED Screens
This is the repo for the files for this project.

Just in case you want to look at hastily written code that ~doesn't really work~ *working code that most certainly does work*.

serialvideo.ino is the main arduino code I wrote for this project. It is not good code
cleanserial.ino is the alternative, much more preferable version, but does not work
